### Changed
- Subscribe form defaults to English and no longer auto-matches the site UI language.
- Removed flagship section; redesigned popup top accent.

### Fixed
- Fixed `/options` rendering for the current bilingual object-shaped AI commentary payload and aligned freshness checks with the US market date.
- Subscribe CTA always works regardless of dismiss cache.
- Replaced smart quotes with straight quotes in the popup dictionary.
- Lychee link checker: excluded deferred-download fonts and GitHub Pages clean URLs; uses `--root-dir` (absolute) instead of `--base` for local paths; `--base` retained for root-relative paths; skips Google verification HTML; `/terms` excluded from filesystem check.
